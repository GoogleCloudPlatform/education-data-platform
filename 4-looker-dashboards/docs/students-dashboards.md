# Students and Courses Dashboards

This view illustrates how you can leverage data ingested in the Education Data Platform to understand your student's performance and enrollment metrics. You can use this dashboard as-is, or use it as a starting point for more complex visualizations.

The dashboard is comprised of the following reports:

1. [Students Overview](students-overview-dashboard.md)
2. Students Performance Prediction (coming soon)
3. Enrollment Prediction (coming soon)

The above links will direct you to documentation for each individual report which will describe its contents in more detail.
