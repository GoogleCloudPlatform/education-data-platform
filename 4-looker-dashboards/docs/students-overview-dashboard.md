# Students Overview

The Students Overview Report gives an overview of an education institutionâ€™s students and courses performance measured in years.

The current dashboard version contains data from Moodle 4.0. However, integration with other educational systems is coming soon.

## Filter Bar & Scorecards

This report allows users to filter data by year, academic career, or subject. When a filter is applied, all charts and scorecards on the page will be updated to use those filters. Dashboard owners and editors can define a default year range that is most suitable for their use case.

Alongside the filters are several scorecards that provide general statistics including total students in the source repository, total courses, total academic careers, and general students' average grade.
